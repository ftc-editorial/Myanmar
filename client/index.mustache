              <p>Hla Ohn May still weeps when she takes the road past the twisted white piping of the gas terminal near the western Myanmar town of Kyaukphyu. The 46-year-old farmer and mother of five once owned land on this green strip perched above the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal.</p>
              <p>Then she and fellow villagers were bought out by a consortium, which included the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation and the Korean conglomerate Daewoo. Kyaukphyu is now the starting point for a pair of immense Beijing-backed transnational energy pipelines, turning these wild shores into what some are calling “China’s west coast”.</p>

                 <p>The development is a big part of fast-opening Myanmar’s efforts to exploit its position at the crossroads of Asia. The lush fields where Ms Hla Ohn May and other farmers used to plant rice and beans are mere industrial landscaping now, manicured behind fences by company workers in orange jumpsuits. Ms Hla Ohn May was paid Kt2.78m ($2,250 at current exchange rates) but feels she was short-changed for giving up the only productive asset she ever had. </p>
                 <p>“Because we don’t have those lands any more, we became poor people who have to work as labourers for others,” she says of the gas terminal’s impact. “I cried everyday when I saw all those buildings.” </p>

             <p>For both would-be investors and the genuine reformers in Myanmar’s new government, conflict over land is a great spectre overshadowing their plans. A committee set up by parliament in 2012 to explore so-called <a href="https://www.ft.com/land" target="_blank">land grabs</a> since 1988 said in November that it had received about 17,000 complaints. Activists say these are a fraction of the number of actual disputes. Most of the alleged victims are farmers, in a country where as many as two-thirds of the population are estimated to depend directly or indirectly on agriculture. </p>
              <p>Land disputes cast a pall over the landslide win last year by Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. One of her first acts was to launch a litter-picking drive, in a symbolic beautification of a long-neglected country. But her party, and the old military elite that still looms large above it, have the much harder task of dealing with old grievances over land and finding ways to avoid creating new ones. The sustainability of the country’s internationally-lauded but fragile transition may depend on it. </p>
              <p>Myanmar’s land battles are also deterring investment in a country that wants more of it. They form one of the most significant risks identified by businesses coming in. That includes past land-grabbing by the state. Investors fear the horrors of contested ownership, with all the legal complications, financial penalties and bad publicity that it can bring. </p>

               <p>The battle for land is also a theme that resonates well beyond Myanmar. The country’s difficulties may be extreme, but its themes of speculation, tensions between big companies and local communities, and the loss of long-established livelihoods have a universal aspect. </p>
               <p>In a poor, mainly agrarian nation with many remote regions and areas outside government control, land is both a priceless material asset and an emotional entity that feeds into people’s sense of self. It is a crucial glue in society and clashes over it create a risk of unrest. </p>
               <p>“Land is not just a matter of a map or an area,” says Shwe Thein, head of the Land Core Group, an NGO focused on smallholder land rights in Myanmar. “Land rights are the basic requirement to ensure livelihoods and food security for people in this country. They are important for their culture, traditional practices and also their social cohesion. Land is their life.” </p>

                <p>Last year’s election marked a crucial step in Myanmar’s opening to the world after almost half a century of military rule. Its economic growth rates of more than 8 per cent and strategic position at the heart of Asia have drawn intense international interest since the generals stepped down in 2011. </p>
                  <p>McKinsey, the consultancy, has forecast that the economy could more than quadruple in size from its 2010 level to top $200bn by 2030. Consumer businesses have swarmed in, including Unilever, Coca-Cola and the brewers Heineken and Carlsberg. </p></p>

                 <p>The country is also blessed with rich natural resources. <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bb0e732c-fc6e-11e3-86dc-00144feab7de.html#axzz3yw5FN3fQ" target="_blank">Oilfield auctions</a> since the end of absolute military rule have attracted players ranging from Chevron of the US, the Netherlands and UK’s Royal Dutch Shell and India’s Reliance Industries to a Kazakhstan gas magnate and assorted local tycoons. </p>
                <p>Some extractive industries are dogged, however, by allegations of human rights abuses and corruption. The production of highly prized green jade has been estimated at $31bn annually, or almost half of official gross domestic product. Much of it is smuggled across the northern border to feed a market driven by China’s new rich. </p>
                <p>Myanmar has ambitions to become Asia’s next factory floor, as China grows more expensive and its workers more assertive. Gap and H&amp;M source clothes from factories in the industrial areas springing up and growing around Yangon, the country’s biggest city and commercial centre. Big hurdles ranging from infrastructure to electricity supply still need to be overcome, but labour costs are low. The minimum wage is just 36 cents an hour, compared with at least $1.65 an hour in China. </p>
                <p>The Myanmar authorities have launched plans for a network of industrial zones, in the hope of fuelling a boom. An area at the heart of the island on which Kyaukphyu is located is due to become a complex of more than 4,000 acres with deep-sea port facilities, factories and fisheries. Officials have touted the Kyaukphyu special economic zone as a “mini-Singapore”, potentially providing a trade corridor between China, Africa and the Middle East. </p>

                <p>The activity in Kyaukphyu (roughly pronounced Chaw-pyoo) has made it a hotspot for Myanmar’s international development and a crucible for its land disputes. This town, set on rugged coast, is one hour’s flight north-west of Yangon. Once a port developed by the British colonialists and the site of a late second world war battle between Allied and Japanese forces, Kyaukphyu now feels like frontier territory. Gas and oil workers passing through the tiny airport are diverted to immigration officials who check their passport details, even though they have arrived on a domestic flight. </p>
                <p>The town itself projects a sense of slowgoing charm. But beyond the fishermen, beach footballers and beer-and-seafood shacks by the shore, Kyaukphyu is also a way station on a trade route that is geostrategically priceless to China. This littoral sliver of Rakhine state feels like the edge of something, looking out on to the open Indian Ocean. </p>
                <p>Kyaukphyu links the Middle Kingdom to seaways towards south Asia, Africa, the Gulf and beyond. It cuts the long and sometimes perilous journey round the Strait of Malacca, which has long been a piracy hotspot. It also reduces China’s reliance on this crucial channel, to which the US Navy has access through its Southeast Asian regional allies. </p>
                <p>Both the pipelines that start at Kyaukphyu run almost 800km through Myanmar territory to China’s Yunnan province. Each pipeline, about a metre wide, is hidden underground, the only sign of them a narrow cutting that ploughs through the surrounding vegetation. Signboards give passers-by a telephone number to call in case they notice problems. </p>
                <p>The gas pipeline project started operations in 2013 and is the product of co-investment from the Myanmar government and five companies from China, Korea and India, including CNPC and Daewoo. South East Asia Gas Pipeline Company, as it is known, did not respond to questions from the Financial Times. </p>

                                <p>如果要挑选2015年中国最热的一组数字，答案是“7%”。再精确一点，是“7%左右”。</p>
                                <p>今年3月，中国总理李克强在“两会”期间将全年经济增速调整为增长“7%左右”，开启一整年的“小数点”论战：国家统计局数据和市场预期若有落差，总有大量声音质疑官方数字的客观性和准确性。</p>
                                <p>数据纷争，纠结的并不是小数点后的表面数字，所有人更想追问一个核心问题：中国经济增速到底放慢多少？假如看好中国经济持续增长，官方和民间理解的国内生产总值（GDP）数据若产生微幅差距不是问题。但在今年，市场更多的声音是，中国官方恐怕高估了GDP。眼前的中国正承受经济下行的巨大压力，投资者和经济观察家更需要精确的GDP数字，以帮助他们理解中国当前及未来走势。</p>
                                <p>我们试着整理今年主要专家学者的看法和研究，从头开始带你理解：官方发布数字和市场预估究竟有何差距？以及应该如何解懂中国GDP？</p>
                                <p>计算基础不同，是民间和官方数据落差的主因。</p>
                                <p>凯投宏观（Capital Economics）认为，面对今年进口价格下跌，用来衡量通货膨胀、显示名义和实际GDP差距的“平减指数” （GDP deflator）被中国低估，如此会造成最终GDP实际数值高估。专家学者的怀疑不是没理由，中国官方未公开平减指数的计算。</p>
                                <p>官方数据的支持者、香港科技大学经济学教授霍尔兹（Carsten Holz）也认为，中国官方名义GDP可信赖，但GDP平减指数恐怕存在问题。</p>
                                <p>长期研究中国经济议题的东京一桥大学（Hitotsubashi University）经济学教授伍晓鹰（Harry Wu），<a href="http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001064428" target="_blank">站在另一个角度怀疑中国官方数据</a>。他认为，官方数据存有根本错误，高估“非物质服务业”和“工业产出增长率”。依据伍晓鹰的计算，在多数情况下，他对增长下滑（如1954、1966年）和经济衰退（如1961、1976年）的估计数字都比官方数据更加严重。</p>
                                <P>虽然理解官方和民间计算基础的差异，但假如在分析上全盘使用官方数据进行计算，又会因为数据的模糊空间，很难通过官方口径看到全貌。以下，我们就用几道简单的数学运算来展示问题点。</P>

                 <p>The Myanmar company overseeing the zone’s development said management had promised residents that resettlement plans would meet Asian Development Bank standards. This would include compensation for land as well as jobs, training and allocation of new agricultural land to those who wanted to continue to farm. </p>
                  <p>Around the country, foreign companies with ambitions to do business in Myanmar are only too aware that land can be a flashpoint. </p>
                            <p>H&amp;M, the Swedish retailer, began fully sourcing clothes from Myanmar suppliers in 2014. It says it required them to show documentation of their land acquisition and conduct legal reviews of the risks associated with each factory site’s history. If H&amp;M found uncertainties, it consulted non-governmental groups on the circumstances. </p>
                            <p>Heineken says it re-entered Myanmar with its “eyes wide open” about land rights. It sought advice from institutions and individuals including Human Rights Watch, the EU ambassador to Myanmar and the US embassy in Thailand. It used a law firm to analyse relevant land titles and did due diligence to make sure neither its local business partner nor the proposed brewery site had been embroiled in land disputes. It also did “extensive outreach with local community leaders/groups”. So far, it says it has not experienced any land-related problems. </p>
                            <p>Some of the causes of Myanmar’s land battles lie very deep. Everyone and no one has responsibility for regulating them. The country has more than 30 land-related laws, going back to when it was part of 19th-century British Imperial India, according to the Land Core Group. </p>
                            <p>More than 20 government agencies have some kind of involvement with land management. Law changes since the military stepped down have made it easier for authorities to seize land that they class as unoccupied, even though communities have traditionally used it for farming, fishing or firewood. A comprehensive land law is still being drafted. </p>
                            <p>Where once authorities drove people off their land at gunpoint, they now tend to use the courts and the language of the rule of law, say activists. </p>

              <p>The lingering trail of troubles left by Myanmar’s land battles is nowhere clearer than on the doorstep of Inle Lake, one of the country’s premier tourist attractions in the giant eastern state of Shan. </p>
              <p>Not far from the town of Nyaung Shwe, the gateway to the lake, some villagers are at loggerheads with one of Myanmar’s biggest companies over events that happened more than 15 years ago. </p>
               <p>KBZ is a mining-to-banking conglomerate founded by Aung Ko Win, a high-profile schoolteacher turned tycoon who has shown a great capacity for reinvention. Once sanctioned by the EU for his alleged links to the former junta — US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks claim he has acknowledged being close to a senior general and receiving mining concessions through him — he is now rapidly taking advantage of the global appetite for Myanmar. </p>
               <p>Mr Aung Ko Win has ridden out criticism about his past and his company’s activities, including its involvement in the controversial jade industry. In September KBZ formed a partnership with Microsoft to improve its information technology infrastructure. The company’s bank also won an award last year given by The Banker magazine, part of the Financial Times group. </p>

              <p>Farmers near Nyaung Shwe say their land was taken in 1999 by the authorities and given to a trading company that is part of the KBZ empire. Ko Win Oo, a community leader and former pro-democracy activist, says he was one of more than 40 people who lost a combined total of about 78 acres. They were given other land to the north in compensation, but when they got there, other people claimed ownership. </p>
              <p>Mr Ko Win Oo says nothing has been done since then to use the seized land. He and his fellow villagers cannot farm but the holdings lie idle. As Mr Ko Win Oo stands in front of the fields, empty but for a few water buffalo splashing around, he starts to sob. “Since they took all the lands, we farmers can’t do anything about it but cry,” he says. “We can’t do anything but watch. Even if we wanted to, we are not allowed to work on those fields.” </p>
              <p>Few answers are to be found at Nyaung Shwe’s local government land office. It is a Dickensian set-up where clerks mill round desks weighed down by piles of paper. It has no email address and the head of the office did not respond to a written note requesting comment. </p>
              <p>KBZ denies any wrongdoing and says it paid the government for the land, although it could not provide details of the deal. Nyo Myint, a former army engineer and the managing director of the KBZ group of companies, says Mr Aung Ko Win “bid through correct channels for mining prospects and in no way [benefited from] privileged connections”. </p>
             <p>The land was intended as a tourism venture to benefit local communities, he says, and the villagers have been fairly compensated. However, he promised to look into their complaints. “We never grab money and we never grab land. We don’t want to have a bad reputation.” </p>
